1. Create a base class "Employee" with the following protected properties:
    - Name (string)
    - Salary (double)
    - Position (string)

2. Implement a constructor in "Employee" that initializes its values.

3. Add a virtual method "CalculateBonus()" that returns a bonus of 5% of the salary.

4. Add a method "ShowInfo()" that displays the employee's details:
    - Name
    - Position
    - Salary
    - Calculated bonus

5. Create two derived classes from "Employee":
    - "TeamLeader": Its bonus is 10% of the salary.
    - "Developer": Its bonus is 7% of the salary.

6. Instantiate a list of employees with at least the following data:
    - Carlos (Team Leader, 5000)
    - Ana (Developer, 4000)
    - Laura (Team Leader, 6000)
    - Luis (Developer, 3500)

7. Iterate through the list of employees and display the information of each one using the "ShowInfo()" method.
